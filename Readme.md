## 🛠️ Core Concepts

### ☁️ Compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS)
- **EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud is a scalable compute resource that allows you to run virtual servers on-demand.
- **Lambda**: Run code without provisioning or managing servers in a serverless architecture.
- **ECS**: Elastic Container Service for orchestrating Docker containers.

### 📦 Storage (S3, EBS, Glacier)
- **S3**: Scalable object storage with 99.99% durability.
- **EBS**: Elastic Block Storage for persistent storage attached to EC2 instances.
- **Glacier**: Low-cost archive storage for data that is infrequently accessed.

### 🌐 Networking (VPC, Route 53, ELB)
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated network.
- **Route 53**: Scalable DNS and domain name registration.
- **ELB**: Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming application traffic.

## 🔧 Hands-on Practice

### 🖥️ Setting up VPC
1. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS console.
2. Click **Create VPC** and select **CIDR Block** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
3. Add public and private subnets in different Availability Zones.

### 🚀 Launching EC2 Instance
1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Click **Launch Instance** and select the **AMI** (Amazon Machine Image).
3. Choose the **Instance Type** (e.g., `t2.micro`).
4. Configure networking and storage options.

## 💡 Scenarios & Solutions

### 🏗️ High Availability Setup
To ensure high availability:
1. Use **Auto Scaling** groups across multiple **Availability Zones**.
2. Attach an **Elastic Load Balancer** (ELB) for traffic distribution.
3. Use **RDS Multi-AZ** deployments for databases.

### 🔄 Disaster Recovery
- Implement **Cross-Region Replication** for critical data in **S3**.
- Use **Snapshots** for **EBS** volumes and **RDS** databases.
